# Encoder - Decoder
- The ***Training Notebooks*** directory contains the notebooks used to train our models, one notebook for SSA and one for non SSA.
- We included the three best models for 6,9,12 output time steps at the ***models*** directory.
  - All the models are saved in these two Drive directories: 
    - [Non SSA Models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zAWik-qb1n6plS72WJT3EqTcu0IwrEBO?usp=sharing)
    - [SSA Models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nxv3rl6-UyeeZIEBquiMjr95oNC69wjb?usp=sharing)
  
- The notebook ***Test Encoder-Decoder*** is used to test the three models performances and plotting the predictions. This notebook used\
helper functions and modules from the file **utils.py**.
