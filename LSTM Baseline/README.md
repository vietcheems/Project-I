# LSTM
- The ***Training Notebooks*** directory contains the notebooks used to train our models, one notebook for SSA and one for non SSA.
- We included the best performing model in the ***model*** directory.
  - All the models are saved in these two Drive directories: 
    - [Non SSA Models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KWykhpo4tXzJkbPD_QUGlWZ586VKg3s9?usp=sharing)
    - [SSA Models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MVfesaY3aFfoexT4xSjq1aB9TG3wUloa?usp=sharing)
  
- The notebook ***Test LSTM*** is used to test the best model's performances and plotting the predictions. This notebook used\
helper functions and modules from the file **utils.py**.
